# wordpress-starter-theme
A WordPress starter theme to get up and running fast. Dependent on Compass, Sass and Susy.

This is just a basic theme with the basic theme templates required to build a theme. This theme assumes that you will be adding in your own PHP/HTML for fleshing out the templates (ex: header.php, etc..,).

If you don't need a specific theme template, just delete it!

I like using Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), so I created a director for any partial include files you may want to include. Again, if you don't use ACF in your theme development, just remove the folder :)

This repository is my first real attempt at using GitHub, so please forgive any "newbie" errors.
